# Testing my skills in vanilla JavaScript, CSS3, and BootStrap HTML5 with a converter 
This is a game (Whack-A-Mole) developed using pure *__HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript__* and *Babel* for transpilation.

#### Note: 
This program doesn't follow certain JavaScript best practices as such. I am fully aware of certain corrections to be made and I plan on making them with further commits. I also welcome feedbacks, as I believe this will help me improve and become a better developer.
